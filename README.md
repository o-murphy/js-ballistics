## About project

The library provides trajectory calculation for projectiles including for various
applications, including air rifles, bows, firearms, artillery and so on.

3DF model that is used in this calculator is rooted in old C sources of version 2 of the public version of JBM
calculator, ported to C#, optimized, fixed and extended with elements described in
Litz's "Applied Ballistics" book and from the friendly project of Alexandre Trofimov
and then ported to Go.

Now it's also ported to python3 and expanded to support calculation trajectory by 
multiple ballistics coefficients and using custom drag data (such as Doppler radar data Â©Lapua, etc.)

Next stage is porting it to JavaScript

Go documentation can be obtained using godoc tool.

The current status of the project is ALPHA version.

#### RISK NOTICE

The library performs very limited simulation of a complex physical process and so it performs a lot of approximations. Therefore, the calculation results MUST NOT be considered as completely and reliably reflecting actual behavior or characteristics of projectiles. While these results may be used for educational purpose, they must NOT be considered as reliable for the areas where incorrect calculation may cause making a wrong decision, financial harm, or can put a human life at risk.
